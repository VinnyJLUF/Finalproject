			<p class="para">Becoming a student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a> is excited and challenging. My first goal is to graduate as "Frontend Web Developement" courses so this may lead me to be a web developer for my church group and future job/ freelancer. I may continue to take more courses at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful </a> once I mastered as Frontend Web Developer.</p>
			<p class="para">I always go by this quote, "One things at a time" -Whomever said this earlier before it come to my mind that this does inspire me that I tend to do one things at a time because that how progressively I am. I may sound like a robust at this but who care. I love bold black coffee, green "veggie & fruit" smoothie, and green tea.</p>

			<h5>What's Important To Me?</h5>
			<p>Lord Jesus Christ is important to my entire life. I came to Him in 2011 when I was so devasted-depressive when I drop out of college *twice*, smoking weeds, drinking and moping myself all over the town in Rochester, NY. Over time, I found a way to escape my old bad habit into a good habit of staying clean in Christ. It took me a long time but I have learned so much about how blessing I am to come to Him through the power of prayer. With the power of prayer, He lead me to be closer to Him by supernatural dream/ vision, bible study, fellowship with brethren and so on. I pray in His name that everyone else will get to know Him in a due time just like I did. It would be woe to those that keep their door locked against the Lord's coming.</p>

			<h5>What's My Dream Job?</h5>
